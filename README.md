# Plotly and Belly Button Biodiversity

## Purpose of the Project

- The purpose of this project is to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Results

- A bar chart was created to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. 
- A bubble chart was created to display the bacterial cultures per sample when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage.
- A gauge chart was created to the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

## Imoprovements Made on the Original HTML File

- Several improvements were made on the original HTML file given by the Module.
- A backgroud colour of plum (a light purple) was added.
- A paragraph describing the purpose of the project was added to the top of the page.
- There are now paragraphs below each graph that explains the purpose of that graph.
